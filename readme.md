The Compendium 
============================== 
The Compendium is a computer science capstone about other computer science capstones completed during the spring semester of 2018 at American University. More specifically, it is an archive that has an administration facing view, a developer view, and a visitor/user view. Its foundations are in Wagtail, which uses Django as its framework. The archive will not be served by me (Yan), but instead by the department at a later date. Nonetheless, documentation for how to deploy The Compendium will be included in the README.
